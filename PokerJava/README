POKER is one of the most played card games using the standard 52 card deck with 4 suits.

After I recreated this game as a personal learning experience in the language C# as I decided to test myself again by recreating 
transfering the game to java code. Using a virtual deck a player is set against up to 5 fake players. The game proceeds based on stage of 
the actual game. Once all the cards are dealt at the end of the game, the application determines which player has the strongest hand 
including ties.

To discourage irresposible gambling, features such as betting and AI player actions have been intendedly omitted.
