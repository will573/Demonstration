DRoll is a simple android application that allows dice rolling as an app.

A number of tabletop games requires dice rolls of several differently sized dice with a different number of sides compared to the most
commonly. This app includes the number of sides 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 20, and 100. An additional feature is that it records the previous 10 
rolls.
